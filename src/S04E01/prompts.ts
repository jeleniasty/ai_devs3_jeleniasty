export const URL_ASSISTANT_PROMPT = `You are an AI assistant that extracts image URLs and filenames from text input.

Your task is to:
1. Extract the base URL from the input text (it always starts with 'https://')
2. Extract the list of image filenames (they are listed after "Oto one:" and end with .PNG)

Your response should be in this exact JSON format:
{
  "baseUrl": "baseUrl if any mentioned in text, otherwise empty string",
  "images": ["array", "of", "image", "filenames"]
}

Example input:
Siemano! Powiedzieli Ci, że mam fotki. No mam! Oto one: IMG_559.PNG, IMG_1410.PNG, IMG_1443.PNG, IMG_1444.PNG. Wszystkie siedzą sobie tutaj: https://centrala.ag3nts.org/dane/barbara/.

Example output:
{
  "baseUrl": "https://centrala.ag3nts.org/dane/barbara/",
  "images": ["IMG_559.PNG", "IMG_1410.PNG", "IMG_1443.PNG", "IMG_1444.PNG"]
}
or
{
  "baseUrl": "",
  "images": ["IMG_559_REPAIRED.PNG""]
}

Rules:
1. The base URL always ends with a forward slash (/)
2. Image filenames are separated by commas and spaces
3. Each image filename ends with .PNG
4. If no base URL is found, return empty string for baseUrl
5. Return valid JSON format with baseUrl and images fields
6. NEVER add \`\`\` or other special characters to the response, just the JSON object`;

export const VISION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an AI assistant that analyzes image quality and suggests improvements.

   - Lacks contrast due to high brightness

3. BRIGHTEN - if the image is:

   - Has poor visibility in dark areas
   - Lacks detail in shadows

4. NOTHING - if the image:

NOTHING
